    <h3>
        <p>Hearty and healthy breakfast cookies are naturally gluten free, vegan, low in sugar, and not only taste good—they taste incredible. Made in 1 bowl and ready in 30 minutes, these easy oatmeal cookies will become your new favorite healthy breakfast. I share plenty of substitution ideas below, too.</p>
    </h3>
    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (160g) quick oats or old-fashioned whole rolled oats</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup (250g) almond butter, peanut butter, or sunflower seed butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) pure maple syrup (or honey)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (60g) apple sauce</li>
        <li>1 large banana, mashed (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (75g) dried cranberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (75g) raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine all of the ingredients into a large bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer). Mix until all of the ingredients are combined. The dough is thick and heavy.</li>
        <li>Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, portion 1/4 cup mounds of cookie dough (about 70g each) onto prepared cookie sheet. Use the back of a spoon to slightly flatten out into a cookie shape. (The cookies will not spread in the oven.)</li>
        <li>Bake for 16–19 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Cool cookies on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover cookies and store at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.</li>
    </ol>
